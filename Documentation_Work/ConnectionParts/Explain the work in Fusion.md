# Changes to be done 
The connection parts are the pieces between the frame and the hull to mount the frame sheet onto the hull. Originially, the parts are meade of ASA and a bold and nutis used to connect the frame sheet with the connection part.

In the previous design, a standard hex M6 nut was utilized. However, due to exposure to saltwater in the submarine's environment, these nuts corroded over time. The resulting corrosion increased the torque required to unscrew the nut from the bolt to such an extent that it caused damage to the connecting parts during attempts to remove the hull from the frame.

To prevent a recurrence of this issue during future disassembly operations, it is imperative to replace the existing nuts with alternatives that offer a stronger surface connection to the connecting parts. This enhancement will bolster the assembly's ability to withstand the torque applied during disassembly, thereby averting potential damage.
