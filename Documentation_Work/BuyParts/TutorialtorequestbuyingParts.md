## What to put in the Description?

There are 3 catergories of purchases:
1. 0-50€: You can buy that by yourself and give the receipt to Prof. Megill with your bank details and the reasons why you needed that part. (be careful it can be 6 months until you get the money back). The second option is that you can put in the link with the part you want to buy and Prof. Megill will buy it for you, this can be any link from any supplier, but be careful the ordering from Prof. Megill side can take 2 months :(
2. 50-200€: Put one link of that part in the description. The supplier or vendor needs to be european otherwise we can not buy it.
3. more than 200€: You need to list 3 options of that part from different european suppliers and mark the best option.
